Designed to give your projects an edge in their lighting capacity, the SparkFun Lumenati 4-pack is a coin-sized board equipped with four APA102C LEDs surrounding the outer edge. The 4-pack board can be daisy-chained with other Lumenati boards, thanks to the multiple SMD pads on the back allowing for multiple design options and formations.
